# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app

![Design preview for the Age calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS animations

### What I learned

While building this project i leanred about how to use the JavaScript Date method and its diffrent uses. I had to try a couple of methods to get till the logic needed to finish this project. I also experimented with validation and learned a few new techniques.

Below is some proud CSS and JS code snippets

```css
.an {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}

@keyframes example {
  from {
    color: hsl(258, 17%, 88%);
  }
  to {
    color: hsl(259, 75%, 41%);
  }
  to {
    color: hsl(259, 100%, 65%);
  }
}
```

```js
let date = new Date(); // get today full date
let day = date.getDate(); // todays date
let month = date.getMonth() + 1; // current month
let currentYear = date.getFullYear(); // current year

const Months = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]; // Array of days of months

function animate() {
  span.forEach((e) => {
    e.className = "an";
  });
}

function validateDay() {
  let value = dayInput.value;
  let monthvalue = monthInput.value;
  if (value == "") {
    dayInput.style.borderColor = "red";
    dayError.innerHTML = EmptyErrMesg;
    return false;
  } else if (value > Months[monthvalue - 1] || value < 1) {
    dayInput.style.borderColor = "red";
    dayError.innerHTML = dayErrMesg;
    return false;
  } else {
    dayError.innerHTML = "";
    dayInput.style.borderColor = "black";
    return true;
  }
}
```
